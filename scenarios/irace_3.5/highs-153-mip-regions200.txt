## Scenario setup for Iterated Race (iRace).
############################################################################
## To use the default value of a parameter of iRace, simply do not set
## the parameter (comment it out in this file, and do not give any
## value on the command line).

## File that contains the description of the parameters.
parameterFile = "../../algorithms/highs-v153/irace_3.5/parameters.txt"

## Executable called for each configuration that executes the target algorithm
## to be tuned. See the templates and examples provided.
targetRunner = "../../algorithms/highs-v153/target-runner-cap"

## Directory where tuning instances are located, either absolute path or
## relative to current directory.
trainInstancesDir = "../../data/mip/Regions200/"

## File that contains a list of training instances and optionally additional
## parameters for them. If `trainInstancesDir` is provided, `irace` will
## search for the files in this folder.
trainInstancesFile = "../../instances/mip/Regions200/training.txt"

## Directory where testing instances are located, either absolute or relative
## to current directory.
testInstancesDir = trainInstancesDir

## File containing a list of test instances and optionally additional
## parameters for them.
testInstancesFile = "../../instances/mip/Regions200/testing.txt"

## Maximum total execution time for the executions of `targetRunner`.
## `targetRunner` must return two values: cost and time. This value and the
## one returned by `targetRunner` must use the same units (seconds, minutes,
## iterations, evaluations, ...).
maxTime = 86400

## Indicates the number of decimal places to be considered for the
## real parameters.
digits = 4

## Maximum execution bound for `targetRunner`. It must be specified when
## capping is enabled.
boundMax = 60

## Enable the use of adaptive capping, a technique designed for minimizing the
## computation time of configurations. Capping is enabled by default if
## `elitist` is active, `maxTime > 0` and `boundMax > 0`.
capping = 1 # This is not needed for irace >= 3.5 but previous versions required it.
